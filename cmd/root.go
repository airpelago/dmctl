Could not connect to docker. Docker is necessary in order to run Drone Mission Control onboard software.

If docker is not installed, please install it by following the instructions at: https://docs.docker.com/install/

If docker is running, you might need to run this CLI as sudo. You can also add permissions for the current user to use docker:

  sudo usermod -aG docker USER

Note that these changes require logout to take affect.
